#### WORLD CLASS HOME HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS SERVICES

##Wha it does
This app was made during CoHack Hackathon for a startup HealersAtHome.com.This app provides healthcare right at your home through internet services.It has 3 different modules.1st is "Consult A Doctor" in this module we provide a chat forum .A chat forum has two namespaces "client" & "doctor".Any user can be a client while doctors are registered by system admin and given a secret url for authentication.Now in this chatroom unlike others  client can send private  msg to doctor only after paying  token money so that it wont be polluted chatroom..A client can broadcast any random msg in chat room but that random message will not bother doctor .Also a client can't send msg to another client in chat room.This helps in keeping chat room clean and simple.
Second Module is "Medicine recommendation Bot" it is like a search engine for medicine recommendation where medicines are fetched using combination of apis such as truemd api.Also if some user misspells his disease('Vomitting' as 'Vomiting') then our bot will also recommend him correct word using 'Levenshtein distance algorithm'.
Third module is 'Ambulance SOS' this module aim to be Uber for HealthCare and will help in socializing task of providing first aid to accidental or any emergency patient.When a user will submit a request of any emergency case to our platform.Our platform will broadcast that message to every user which is subscribed to get alerts from our platform and withing 30 KM vicinity of that patient or accidental area.They will get both a SMS and mail using twilio and gmail api so that even the user who is not connected to internet will get a alert.So the ones who is currently connected to internet will get both SMS and mail and the ones who are not connected to internet will get a SMS.
This helps is eliminating the problem of Ambulance and healthcare services in remote areas and will provide earliest relief to patient.
